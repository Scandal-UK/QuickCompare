## WinQuickCompare

[Return to main project](/../../)

#### Instructions

Run the application in Microsoft Windows and add the two connection strings in the input boxes on-screen.

Hit the button to run the comparison! A report will be generated and displayed on-screen for you to read or copy.

View differences between definitions (which is what SQL calls the body of a view, function or stored procedure) on the second tab. Textual differences are highlighted here by a control from [DiffPlex.Wpf](https://www.nuget.org/packages/DiffPlex.Wpf/).

Note that form values are persisted across application restarts for your convenience. This prevents you from repeatedly entering the connection strings that you commonly use.
