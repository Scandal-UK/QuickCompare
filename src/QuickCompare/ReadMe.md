## QuickCompare UI

[Return to main project](/../../)

#### Instructions

Run the application and add the two connection strings in the input boxes on-screen.

Hit the button to run the comparison!

View differences between definitions (which is what SQL calls the body of a view, function or stored procedure) on the second tab. Differences are highlighted here by the DiffPlex NuGet package.

Note that form values are persisted across application restarts for your convenience.
